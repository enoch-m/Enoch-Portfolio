            <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in the heart of Queens, New York, but decided to take a leap of faith and see what lay beyond my city, ultimately landing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There, I studied Information Science and Psychology, where I came to appreciate how every person brings a unique story and perspective worth understanding. Now I am all about using what I’ve learned to develop solutions and tools that are intuitive, inclusive, and inspiring for people who utilize them.

            <h2>Leadership & Community</h2>
            <p>
                As an active member and leader of my community in my student organization, I helped organize community events and attended leadership conferences to find new ways to make our space more inclusive and engaging. Along the way, I’ve made countless friends and learned that meaningful relationships are built through empathy, shared purpose, and a desire to listen and grow together.

            <h2>Creativity Through Music</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of my work, I find joy in expressing myself through music. Growing up, I had the chance to learn several instruments, and over time the practice paid off and it became more than just a hobby. It became a way for me to connect and have fun with others.
